Atmosphere Simulator

This little app is intended to help visualize, in an admittedly crude way, 
the main gases that make up our atmosphere, along with the space between the
molecules, the space between molecules actually being about 99.9 % of what 
we think of as 'air'.

It is intended to help people comprehend the amount of Carbon Dioxide that is actually
in the air. People hear the term 400 parts per million, and it sounds impressive, but 
how does that number compare with the atmosphere as a whole?

This app puts coloured pixels onto a black or white canvas that lets you visualise
the amount of CO2 is in our atmosphere relative to all the other gases that make up
the air that we breathe.
